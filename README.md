### Description
I'm actually learning a full-stack engineering program at [ALX](https://alxafrica), and this repository describes my learning journey. <br>

#### Fun fact
>Thi DevOps project is to write basic shell commands to do specific tasks. As a software engineer, you should be able to write, interpret, and deal with any Linux commands and operating system.
